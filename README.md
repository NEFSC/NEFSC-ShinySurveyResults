# NEFSC Shiny Group Survey Results 

This repo contains processed survey data from the R Shiny Group Survey conducted in June 2021 at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. 

The R Shiny group (https://github.com/NEFSC/Shiny-User-Group) gathers bi-weekly to discuss all things Shiny and developed this survey to gain a better understanding of how and where people are using R in their work, to identify common bottlenecks and areas where we can further support each other, and to highlight the need for public facing tool to host shiny apps.
